# Project : Image classifiaction in Azure cognitive services 

I used Cognitive Services in one of my project which brings AI within reach of every developer and data scientist. With leading models, a variety of use cases can be unlocked. All it takes is an API call to embed the ability to see, hear, speak, search, understand and accelerate advanced decision-making into your apps. Enable developers and data scientists of all skill levels to easily add AI capabilities to their apps.

The space of cognitive services has grown up too fast with the advent of various pre-trained services provided by various public cloud providers such as Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud. This space has become more promising with its coverage to solve most of the common business use cases across industry domains.
The post will mainly look into various Cognitive Services offered by Microsoft Azure, it is worthy to discuss the capabilities of each service and solutions which they can offer. This is going to be series of posts starting with an introduction to these services: 1) Cognitive Vision, 2) Cognitive Text Analytics, 3) Cognitive Language Processing, 4) Knowledge Processing and Search.
